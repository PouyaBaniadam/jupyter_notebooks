# üß† Clustering

This Jupyter Notebook provides a **comprehensive, hands-on exploration of clustering techniques** using Python.  
It covers both **K-Means** and **Hierarchical Clustering** methods with clear explanations, real-world examples, and visualizations.

---

## üìò Overview

Clustering is an **unsupervised learning** technique used to group similar data points together.  
This notebook walks through the **end-to-end process** ‚Äî from theoretical concepts to implementation and visualization.

## üß© Contents

1. **Introduction to Clustering**
   - What is clustering and why it matters
   - Real-world applications

2. **Data Preparation**
   - Using example datasets (Bank, Cars)
   - Feature selection and scaling using `StandardScaler`

3. **K-Means Clustering**
   - Distance metrics (Euclidean distance)
   - Choosing the right number of clusters with the **Elbow Method**
   - Visualization of K-Means results
   - Interpreting cluster characteristics

4. **Hierarchical Clustering**
   - Concept of agglomerative clustering
   - Distance matrix and linkage criteria (single, complete, average)
   - Dendrogram visualization
   - Implementation with `AgglomerativeClustering` (Scikit-learn)
   - Visualizing hierarchical clusters

5. **Cluster Evaluation & Insights**
   - Cluster centroids and interpretation
   - Comparing K-Means vs Hierarchical clustering

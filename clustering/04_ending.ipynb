    "### Conclusion\n",
    "\n",
    "This report provided a comprehensive introduction to the principles and practices of clustering, a fundamental task in unsupervised machine learning. The primary objective of clustering—to group data by maximizing inter-cluster distance and minimizing intra-cluster distance—was established as the core concept.\n",
    "\n",
    "We explored three foundational algorithms, each representing a different approach to identifying structure in unlabeled data:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **K-Means:** A fast, centroid-based method ideal for identifying simple, spherical clusters.\n",
    "2.  **Hierarchical Clustering:** A connectivity-based method that builds a complete hierarchy of clusters, visualized through a dendrogram.\n",
    "3.  **DBSCAN:** A density-based method with the unique ability to find arbitrarily shaped clusters and effectively identify noise and outliers.\n",

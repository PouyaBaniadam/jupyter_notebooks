    "# DBSCAN Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a powerful clustering algorithm where clusters can be any shape, not just round, and their sizes can be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, in an algorithm like K-Means, every single datapoint is forced into a cluster, no matter how far away or out of place it is. DBSCAN thinks differently. It believes that for a point to be part of a cluster, it must be in a \"dense\" or crowded neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN classifies every point into one of three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Core Point:** A point in the heart of a dense cluster.\n",
    "*   **Border Point:** A point on the edge of a dense cluster.\n",
    "*   **Outlier (Noise):** A point that doesn't belong to any dense cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](assets/core_border_outlier.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which type each point is, DBSCAN uses two simple parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`epsilon` (Îµ):** A distance or radius. This defines the \"neighborhood\" around each point.\n",
    "*   **`min_points`:** The minimum number of points required to form a dense region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can define the rules for classifying each point:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A point is a **Core Point** if it has at least `min_points` neighbors (including itself) within its `epsilon` radius.\n",
    "*   A point is a **Border Point** if it has fewer than `min_points` neighbors, but it is close enough to be a neighbor of a **Core Point**.\n",
    "*   If a point is neither a Core nor a Border point, it is considered an **Outlier (Noise)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/recognizing_outliers_borders_cores.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a cluster is formed by connecting Core points that are neighbors of each other. Any Border point that is a neighbor of one of these Core points becomes part of that same cluster. Outliers, belonging to no cluster, are left alone. no clusterings for them!\n",
    "\n",

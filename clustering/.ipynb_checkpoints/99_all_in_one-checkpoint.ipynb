    "*   **Goal:** Group customers to manage financial risk.\n",
    "*   **Input:** The bank uses unlabeled financial data like a customers income, debt, and payment history, age and ....\n",
    "*   **Clustering Action:** The algorithm automatically sorts all customers into distinct groups, such as a **\"Low-Risk\"** cluster and a **\"High-Risk\"** cluster.\n",
    "*   **Impact:** The bank can then use these groups to make decisions. For example, they can offer their best interest rates and products to the Low-Risk group while restricting loans or services to the High-Risk group.\n",

    "For all algorithms in clustering, we actually want to find similarities and dissimilarities.\n",

    "You might wonder why we need dissimilarities! Well the answer is straightforward. As you can see in the image below, we are trying to cluster similar items that are as close as possible together.

    "*   **Average distance**\n",

    "You might ask why we add some more steps like changing the numbers to its second power and then used a radical on all of it. Well, we always try to normalize our data with this method, so that we bring our data on the normal curve. It is always a good practice to do that.\n",

    "### Example Distance Calculation (Euclidean)\n",

    "## K-Means algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means is the most popular and straightforward algorithm for clustering. It is a **centroid-based** algorithm, meaning it relies on finding the center points of the clusters.\n",
    "\n",
    "The algorithm is iterative, following a few simple steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "### The K-Means Steps\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Decide on K:** We first decide on the value of **K**, which is the total number of clusters (groups) we want to find. (*For example, K=3*).\n",
    "\n",
    "2.  **Initialize Centroids:** The algorithm randomly chooses $K$ points in the dataset to act as the initial center points, or **Centroids**.\n",
    "    > ![](assets/kmeans_step1_initial.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "3.  **Assign Points (The Assignment Step):** The algorithm assigns every single data point to the cluster of the **closest Centroid**. This \"closeness\" is calculated using the distance formula (like Euclidean distance).\n",
    "\n",
    "    > ![](assets/kmeans_step2_assignment.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "4.  **Update Centroids:** After all points are assigned, the algorithm moves the Centroid of each cluster to the true center (the **mean position**) of all the points currently assigned to it.\n",
    "\n",
    "5.  **Iterate:** Steps 3 and 4 repeat until the centroids stop moving significantly. This indicates the clusters have stabilized, and the algorithm has **converged**.\n",
    "\n",
    "    > ![](assets/kmeans_step3_converged.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### The Objective Function (Minimizing Error)\n",
    "\n",
    "The entire K-Means process is an attempt to make the clusters as \"tight\" as possible by minimizing the **Sum of Squared Errors (SSE)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\\text{SSE} = \\sum_{i=1}^{n} (x_i - c_j)^2\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "This formula calculates the total squared distance between every data point ($x_i$) and the center ($c_j$) of its cluster. The algorithm keeps running until this total error value is minimized.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Important Notes on K-Means\n",
    "\n",
    "K-Means is fast, but it has a crucial limitation:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Local Optimum:** Because the initial centroids are chosen randomly, K-Means does not guarantee that it will find the absolute best grouping (the global optimum). It might only find a **local optimum**—a good solution for that specific random start.\n",
    "\n",
    "**The Fix:** The standard practice is to **run the K-Means algorithm many times** (e.g., 20 or 50 times) with different random starting points and then choose the final clustering result that has the **lowest overall SSE**.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## Find the best value for the variable \"**_K_**\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok! We know how the system works, but how can we find the **_\"K\"_**? I mean we can give a number like 3 or 4 or ... anything, but it does not really make sense to give at randomly. Well, don't worry; we have a solution for that.\n",
    "\n",
    "As you know if we have _n_ instances, we can have from one up to _n_ clusters. But if we think logically, we cannot have _n_ clusters! Otherwise, what is the point of clustering at all?! From the other hand, we cannot have one cluster too! So we have to discuss the best **_\"K\"_** for this.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first solution is to test the algorithm with different **_\"K\"s_**. Each that has better results and less error, has a higher chance of being the best model out there.\n",
    "\n",
    "The other solution is to draw a plot. The image below is called the \"Elbow method\"\n",

    "After using `StandardScaler`, your data might look something like this:\n",

    "| :--- | :--- | :--- |\n",

    "| **Income** | 45,000 | -0.80 |\n",

    "First, we find the average of our data.\n",

    "Next, we calculate how spread out the data is. This takes a few sub-steps:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  For each number, subtract the mean (36) and square the result.\n",
    "    *   $(25 - 36)^2 = (-11)^2 = 121$\n",

    "    *   $(40 - 36)^2 = (4)^2 = 16$\n",
    "    *   $(50 - 36)^2 = (14)^2 = 196$\n",
    "2.  Find the average of these squared results.\n",
    "    *   $\\frac{121 + 36 + 1 + 16 + 196}{5} = \\frac{370}{5} = 74$\n",
    "3.  Take the square root of that average.\n",
    "    *   $\\sqrt{74} \\approx 8.6$\n",
    "\n",
    "So, the standard deviation (σ) is approximately **8.6**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Step 3: Apply the StandardScaler Transformation\n",
    "\n",

    "$$\n",

    "# DBSCAN Algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise) is a powerful clustering algorithm where clusters can be any shape, not just round, and their sizes can be different.\n",
    "\n",
    "You see, in an algorithm like K-Means, every single datapoint is forced into a cluster, no matter how far away or out of place it is. DBSCAN thinks differently. It believes that for a point to be part of a cluster, it must be in a \"dense\" or crowded neighborhood.\n",
    "\n",
    "DBSCAN classifies every point into one of three types:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **Core Point:** A point in the heart of a dense cluster.\n",
    "*   **Border Point:** A point on the edge of a dense cluster.\n",
    "*   **Outlier (Noise):** A point that doesn't belong to any dense cluster.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    " ![](assets/core_border_outlier.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "To decide which type each point is, DBSCAN uses two simple parameters:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   **`epsilon` (ε):** A distance or radius. This defines the \"neighborhood\" around each point.\n",
    "*   **`min_points`:** The minimum number of points required to form a dense region.\n",
    "\n",
    "Now, we can define the rules for classifying each point:\n",
    "\n",
    "*   A point is a **Core Point** if it has at least `min_points` neighbors (including itself) within its `epsilon` radius.\n",
    "*   A point is a **Border Point** if it has fewer than `min_points` neighbors, but it is close enough to be a neighbor of a **Core Point**.\n",
    "*   If a point is neither a Core nor a Border point, it is considered an **Outlier (Noise)**.\n",

    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "![](assets/recognizing_outliers_borders_cores.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, a cluster is formed by connecting Core points that are neighbors of each other. Any Border point that is a neighbor of one of these Core points becomes part of that same cluster. Outliers, belonging to no cluster, are left alone. no clusterings for them!\n",
